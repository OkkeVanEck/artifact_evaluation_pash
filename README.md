# Artifact Evaluation PaSh
This repository contains an artifact evaluation of [PaSh: Light-touch Data-Parallel Shell Processing](https://github.com/binpash/pash/tree/main). The evaluation is based on the _eurosys-2021-aec-frozen_ branch, so the achieved results can be compared to the original paper. The eurosys branch of the original PaSh repository can be found [here](https://github.com/binpash/pash/tree/eurosys-2021-aec-frozen). 

Due to network device issues, we chose to perform the artifact evaluation on Ubuntu 20.04 instead of Ubuntu 18.04. It does not seem that this creates any issues during setup. However, the installation scripts on the branch do not work out-of-the-box. Hence, we altered some scripts and placed them in this repository. For more details, please look at the report which is also placed in the repository.

_NOTE: All of the code is highly based on the code from PaSh, and thus we do not take any credit._
