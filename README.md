# Artifact Evaluation PaSh
This repo contains code that installs a working version of PaSh. It is based on the eurosys-2021-aec-frozen branch, so results can be compared to the original paper. The code is from this branch, but altered as it did not work out of the box.  
The eurosys branch of the original PaSh repository can be found [here](https://github.com/binpash/pash/tree/eurosys-2021-aec-frozen).

All findings can be found in the artifact evaluation report, which is located in the root of the repo.
